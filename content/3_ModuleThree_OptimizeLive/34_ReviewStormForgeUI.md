Upon logging in to the [StormForge UI](https://app.stormforge.io), it can take up to **1 hour for preliminary** recommendations to be available.

For the first 60 minutes after you've successfully deployed your first StormForge Agent, you may see this graphic in the "Overview" section of the StormForge UI.
