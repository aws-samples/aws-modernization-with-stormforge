StormForge Optimize Live continuously rightsizes Kubernetes workloads to ensure cloud-native applications are both cost effective and performant while removing developer toil. As a vertical pod autoscaling solution, Optimize Live is autonomous, tunable, and works seamlessly with the Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) at enterprise scale.

By combining advanced machine learning-based recommendations with intelligent automation, Optimize Live frees developers from the toil and complexity of setting CPU and memory requests and limits. Optimize Live addresses both over- and under-provisioned resources by analyzing usage data to recommend optimal resource requests and limits. Recommendations can then be automatically deployed on a flexible schedule, so changes in the application resource requirements or traffic patterns are accounted for, ensuring that workloads are always right-sized.

Optimize Live realizes the full potential savings of bidirectional autoscaling by combining the benefits of horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling. By detecting the presence of a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on a workload, Optimize live then sets the HPA target utilization alongside the vertical rightsizing recommendation to ensure optimal application scaling behavior.

Optimize Live was built with ease of use as a core tenet to ensure platform owners get quick time to value across scaled estates intuitively as they seek to improve reliability, reduce the overhead of their environment, and save developers from the pain and distraction of toil.
