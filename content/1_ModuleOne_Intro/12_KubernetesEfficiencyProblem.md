Managing Kubernetes resources is a challenge for any organization that has scaled cloud infrastructure beyond a few hundred workloads. Technology organizations are often in a scenario where either requests are not set at all (leading to reliability issues) or when requests are set, there is a lot of guesswork, so these settings are set arbitrarily high as a safeguard, which leads to wasted resources and overspending.

Platform engineers are stuck making a tradeoff between cost optimization and application reliability or performance, fearing that reducing resources could poorly impact the business. They face pressure from business executives who are looking to reduce operational costs and get a better handle on their ever-growing cloud spend. They all want to make developersâ€™ lives easier by removing toil.
