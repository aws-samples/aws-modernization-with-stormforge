# Introduction

## Learning Objectives 

[StormForge](https://www.stormforge.io/?utm_source=AWS&utm_medium=workshop&utm_campaign=AWS%20workshop%202024) Optimize Live provides continuous workload resource right-sizing to help teams maximize utilization of their Kubernetes compute capacity, minimize waste, and eliminate the risk of poor application performance due to resource under-provisioning.

In this workshop, you will deploy the StormForge Agent into a single cluster and it will automatically discover all workloads. Powerful machine learning will then analyze their resource configurations and usage patterns - providing a comprehensive set of right-sizing recommendations that can be implemented periodically or continuously to maximize your organization's return on their Kubernetes investment.
