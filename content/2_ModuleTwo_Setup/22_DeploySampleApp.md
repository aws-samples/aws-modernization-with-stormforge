It's recommended that there are active workloads deployed onto your Kubernetes cluster for Optimize LIVE to analyze and generate recommendations from.{{% /notice %}}
If your cluster lacks an application with usage, you can follow the documentation [here](https://docs.stormforge.io/optimize-live/guides/showcase-app/#3-install-the-showcase-application) to deploy a sample application which includes a load generator to simulate application usage.

You can also follow the steps in [Getting Started Lab of EKS Workshop](https://www.eksworkshop.com/docs/introduction/getting-started/) to deploy a more complex sample application to experiment with if you are using EKS Workshop setup.
